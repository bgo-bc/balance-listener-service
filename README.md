# Balance Listener Service

The **Balance Listener Service** is a modular Python application designed to aggregate and normalize cryptocurrency account balances across multiple exchanges using [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt).  
It is structured as a monolithic app for now but architected to support distributed deployment in the future.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The service performs the following tasks:

- Connects to configured exchange(s) via secure API credentials  
- Retrieves user balances across multiple account types (spot, earn, funding, etc.)  
- Normalizes the balance data into a consistent format  
- Forwards or stores the results for reconciliation and reporting

Balances are fetched periodically by a scheduler. Accounts to be monitored are registered via an API endpoint.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Highlights

- **FastAPI** â€” provides an HTTP interface for manual balance trigger requests  
- **Async In-Memory Queue** â€” holds pending balance-fetch tasks (replaceable with Redis, NATS, or Celery in future)  
- **Scheduler** â€” periodically enqueues balance fetch tasks for registered accounts  
- **Worker(s)** â€” consume tasks from the queue and perform the actual balance retrieval  
- **Exchange Adapter** â€” a thin abstraction over `ccxt` to handle multiple exchanges consistently

This structure allows easy migration from a single-process design to a distributed microservice setup later.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

### ðŸš€ Starting the Balance Listener Service

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app
```

Once the service is running, open your browser to:
ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

From there, you can **register an account** to start listening for balance updates.

### ðŸ“¡ Listening to NATS Topics (Optional)

If you have NATS installed and running, you can subscribe to the balance updates published by the service.

#### Example: Subscribe to all Deribit balance updates
```bash
nats sub "balance.deribit.*"
```

#### Example: Subscribe to all exchangesâ€™ balances
```bash
nats sub "balance.>"
```

#### Example: Subscribe to specific data categories
```bash
nats sub "positions.binance.*"
nats sub "funding_fees.deribit.*"
```

Each message will contain the **normalized balance or funding data** in JSON format.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:*  
You can use `nats --server nats://localhost:4222` if your NATS server isnâ€™t running on the default endpoint.
